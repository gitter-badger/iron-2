> **NOTE:** Iron is under active development, not production-ready in any sense. If you try to download this in an attempt to write software, you're gonna have a bad time. For more information, see the Progress section below.

**Iron** (abbreviated **Fe**) is a general-purpose programming language, on which development started in 2016.
It is designed to be both flexible and readable; approachable for individuals who come from vastly different
backgrounds. It draws inspiration from many other popular languages, most notably from Python, JavaScript, and C++.
It is built on the LLVM compiler architecture.
