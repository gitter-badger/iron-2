# The Iron Programming Language

**Iron** (abbreviated **Fe**) is a multi-purpose programming language, on which development started in 2016.
It is designed to be both flexible and readable; approachable for individuals who come from vastly different
backgrounds. It draws inspiration from many other popular languages, most notably from Python, JavaScript, C++,
and SystemVerilog.

## Getting Started
